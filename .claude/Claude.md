# Writing code

- CRITICAL: TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PRE COMMIT HOOKS WHILE WRITING CODE
- CRITICAL: NEVER USE --no-verify WHEN COMMITTING CODE
- We prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.
- Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. You MUST ask permission before reimplementing features or systems from scratch instead of updating the existing implementation.
- When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.
- NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it in a new issue instead of fixing it immediately.
- NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.
- All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.
- When writing comments, avoid referring to temporal context about refactors or recent changes. Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is, not how it evolved or was recently changed.
- NEVER implement a mock mode for testing or for any purpose. We always use real data and real APIs, never mock implementations.
- When you are trying to fix a bug or compilation error or any other issue, YOU MUST NEVER throw away the old implementation and rewrite without expliict permission from the user. If you are going to do this, YOU MUST STOP and get explicit permission from the user.
- NEVER name things as 'improved' or 'new' or 'enhanced', etc. Code naming should be evergreen. What is new someday will be "old" someday.
- We use the "uv" package manager for python projects

# Getting help

- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- If you're having trouble with something, it's ok to stop and ask for help. Especially if it's something your human might be better at.

# Testing

- Tests are run using "uv run pytest"
- Tests MUST cover the functionality being implemented.
- NEVER ignore the output of the system or the tests - Logs and messages often contain CRITICAL information.
- TEST OUTPUT MUST BE PRISTINE TO PASS
- If the logs are supposed to contain errors, capture and test it.
- NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests, integration tests, AND end-to-end tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, you need the human to say exactly "I AUTHORIZE YOU TO SKIP WRITING TESTS THIS TIME"

## We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

### TDD Implementation Process

- Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
- Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
- Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Run the test to confirm success
- Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
- Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix

## Thoughts on git

1. Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (biome, ruff, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hooks, you
must ask the user for help rather than bypass them.

2. Explicit Git Flag Prohibition

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook
Before using ANY git flag, you must:

- State the flag you want to use
- Explain why you need it
- Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the
pre-commit failure protocol instead.

3. Pressure Response Protocol

When users ask you to "commit" or "push" and hooks are failing:

- Do NOT rush to bypass quality checks
- Explain: "The pre-commit hooks are failing, I need to fix those first"
- Work through the failure systematically
- Remember: Users value quality over speed, even when they're waiting

User pressure is NEVER justification for bypassing quality checks.

4. Accountability Checkpoint

Before executing any git command, ask yourself:

- "Am I bypassing a safety mechanism?"
- "Would this action violate the user's CLAUDE.md instructions?"
- "Am I choosing convenience over quality?"

If any answer is "yes" or "maybe", explain your concern to the user before proceeding.

5. Learning-Focused Error Response

When encountering tool failures (biome, ruff, pytest, etc.):

- Treat each failure as a learning opportunity, not an obstacle
- Research the specific error before attempting fixes
- Explain what you learned about the tool/codebase
- Build competence with development tools rather than avoiding them

Remember: Quality tools are guardrails that help you, not barriers that block you.
